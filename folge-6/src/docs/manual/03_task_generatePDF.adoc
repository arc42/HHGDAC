This task makes use of the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] plugin to render your documents as a pretty PDF file.

The file will be written to `src/docs/pdf`.

NOTE: the used plugin is still in alpha status, but the results are already quite good.
If you want to use another way to create a PDF, use http://phantomjs.org/[phantomJS] for instance and script it.

The PDF is generated directly from your AsciiDoc sources without the need of an intermediate format or other tools.
The result looks more like a nicely rendered book than a print-to-pdf HTML page.

It is very likely that you need to "theme" you PDF - change colors, fonts, page header and footer.
This can be done by changing the `src/docs/custom-theme.yml` file.
Documentation on how to modify it can be found in the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc[asciidoctor-pdf theming guide].
