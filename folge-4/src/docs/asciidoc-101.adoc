Here you find asciidoc features that we consider useful for software architecture
and similar documentation. Originally this list had been compiled for the
http://aim42.org[aim42] (architecture improvement method) project, later enhanced
by Ralf D. MÃ¼ller and Gernot Starke for their
https://github.com/arc42/hhgdac[Hitchhikers Guide to Docs-as-Code]
article series.

NOTE: http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Alex Efros] has created an extensive and
elaborate AsciiDoc cheatsheet, which you might prefer to ours...

Thanx to Sarah White (@carbonfray)
and Dan Allen (@mojavelinux) for writing
the awesome http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual[AsciiDoc User Manual].

Format text as normal, _italic_, *bold*, +mono+. ``double quoted'', `single quoted'.

=== Small and Large

sometimes [big]#big# is appropriate.
